subtitle: ""
excerpt: "The BRCiS Multi-Donor Drought Response dashboard has been meticulously crafted to exemplify the extent and influence of the multi-donor intervention during the drought crisis that profoundly affected Somalia between 2022 and 2023, following a series of five successive rain season failures. This initiative's success was made achievable through the collaborative financial support from esteemed entities, namely the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO), formerly recognized as UKAID, USAID, and the Qatar Fund For Development (QFFD)."
