  Hi there! Welcome.

I hold a master’s of science in social statistics from the University of Nairobi and a bachelor’s of science in geomatic engineering and GIS from Dedan Kimathi university of technology. I am currently a senior data analyst at Norwegian Refugee council – East Africa and Yemen regional office. Previously, I worked as a junior data scientist and shiny platform developer at World Agroforestry (ICRAF).


I am passionate about data analytics, evidence-based decision-making and developing interactive dashboards to help visualize data outputs in a more user-friendly way.
