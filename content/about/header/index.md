  Hi there! Welcome.

I possess a Master’s of Science in Social Statistics from the esteemed University of Nairobi, complemented by a Bachelor’s of Science in Geomatic Engineering and GIS from the prestigious Dedan Kimathi University of Technology.

In my current capacity, I proudly serve as a Senior Data Analyst at the Norwegian Refugee Council – East Africa and Yemen region. My prior experience includes a role as a Junior Data Scientist and a Shiny Platform Developer at the World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF).

My professional journey has been shaped by a genuine ardor for data analytics, a fervent commitment to evidence-based decision-making, and an innate talent for crafting interactive dashboards that seamlessly translate complex data outputs into user-friendly visualizations.
